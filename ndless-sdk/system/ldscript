        /* The .shlb section is a workaround for calling across
           shared libraries. The automatically generated code veneers
           don't seem to have their addresses relocated properly.

           The workaround involves using the --wrap option in ld
           to wrap library calls into our own code veneers which are
           located in the data section and get relocated properly.

           I've tested putting this section in the .text section
           (argubly where it should belong) but it seems it doesn't get
           relocated correctly if I place it in that section either.

           See the README in https://github.com/tangrs/ndless-bflt-toolchain/tree/master/shared_library_test for more info
